## FQA

1. When utilizing frameworks like Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR), you may encounter the error `ReferenceError: document is not defined`. To address this issue, you can employ dynamic components with `next/dynamic`.

```javascript
// page.ts
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
const Editor = dynamic(() => import('@/components/Editor'), {
  ssr: false,
})
```

```javascript
// Editor.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Md2Poster, Md2PosterContent, Md2PosterHeader, Md2PosterFooter } from 'markdown-to-poster'

function Editor() {
  const markdown = `
